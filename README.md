Overview

In this project, you will use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. You will write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of your project submission, you will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of your queries.

We will begin by getting familiar with the database. We have included Practice Quizzes that include a series of questions that will assure you have mastered the main concepts taught throughout the SQL lessons. These practice quizzes will not be "graded" by a reviewer, but they will help you self-assess and make sure you are on the right track. The quizzes are there to assist you in understanding the database before developing the questions that you wish to include for the project.

The project submission is a presentation, which will be reviewed, and for which you will need to Meet Expectations to pass. For the presentation component, you will create four slides. Each slide will:

Have a question of interest.
Have a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
Have a supporting visualization created using the final data of your SQL query that answers your question of interest.
You will submit your project at the end of the project lessons. Your project will include:

A set of slides with a question, visualization, and small summary on each slide.
A text file with your queries needed to answer each of the four questions.
The essentials of your project submission are discussed on the page labeled as Project Submission.

Project details:

In this project, you will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, you will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the DVD Rental database is provided below.

(Note: One quirk you may notice as you explore this "fake" database is that the rental dates are all from 2005 and 2006, while the payment dates are all from 2007. Don't worry about this. )
